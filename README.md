## Visualizing Different Normalization Techniques


While reading about normalization techniques applied to images, I tried to test them out myself, after failing to find examples on the internet, on different images to see how they transformed them. 

I have tried out 3 techniques and each of them have their separate notebooks. There's the results PDF which has the 8 images and their normalized form.

Here's the [blogpost](https://medium.com/@dibyadas/visualizing-different-normalization-techniques-84ea5cc8c378) accompanying this code.

Feel free to ping me for suggestions and feedback.
